    <dl>
        <dt><strong>ENGLISH</strong> </dt>
        <dd style="font-size:larger;">Personally, my favorite subject is English. I have always scored well on the subject because I understand it well. It makes learning effortless and I always manage to get good marks. There are other subjects I like too but English definitely tops my list. I never get bored of it and am always ready to study it.</dd>
        <dt><strong>MATHEMATICS</strong></dt>
        <dd style="font-size:larger;">My favourite subject is mathematics; since the beginning of my school life, I have always enjoyed solving mathematical equations. I love the subject, also because I always excel in my class, making my mathematics teacher and parents proud.</dd>
        <dt><strong>SCIENCE</strong></dt>
        <dd style="font-size:larger;">Science is one of my favourite subjects in school, nowadays science and technology go hand-in-hand as there is no technology without science and there is no science without technology. Today we are surrounded by various things that have a scientific explanation of existing or behaving in a particular way. </dd>
