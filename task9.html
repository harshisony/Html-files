            <dt><b>Story:</b></dt>
            <dd>Pandu (Mahesh Babu) is a vagabond and ruffian with his heart in the right place – i. e. in money. He’ll do anything for mammon, including murder. Leading a life of crime, he runs into Shruti (Ileana), a girl who brings out the softer side in him. But involved as he is in a fight between two gangs, he cannot commit to her in peace. That is basically what the movie is about – a superhero strategizing and executing gangwars, and rubbing out members. There’s an evil inspector Kiran (Ashish Vidyarthi) who wants to molest Shruti, and Ali (Prakash Raj), the gangster kingpin, in other significant characters.</dd>
            <dt><b> Movie Analysis:</b></dt>
            <dd>Pokiri has the perfect blend of everything an entertaining movie should have. Powerful dialogs, foot-tapping numbers, cheeky romance, great action sequences, fantastic characterization and a mix of a perfect dose of humor interlaced throughout. The director has also reserved some space of suspense with the plot! All these ingredients make Pokiri a must see for the entire family and not just fans of Mahesh. The cast matches the characters to the tee and every one contributes. You'll probably want to watch the movie more than once just to hear Mahesh's dialogs again. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Hats off to Mr. Puri Jagannath!</dd>
